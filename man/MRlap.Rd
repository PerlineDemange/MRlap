\description{
Performs a cross-trait LD score regression, IVW-MR analysis and
BLA BLA BLA CORRECTION!
}
\details{
\code{exposure} and \code{outcome} are required arguments.
The input file / data.frame should contain the following
columns (lower or upper case) : \cr
SNPID (rs numbers) should be : \code{rs}, \code{rsid}, \code{snp}, \code{snpid}, \code{rnpid} \cr
CHR (chromosome) should be :  \code{chr} \cr
POS (position) should be :  \code{pos} \cr
ALT (effect allele) should be : \code{a1}, \code{alt}, \code{alts} \cr
REF (reference allele) should be : \code{a2}, \code{a0}, \code{ref} \cr
Z (z-score) should be : \code{z}, \code{Z}, \code{zscore} \cr
N (sample size) should be :  \code{n} \cr
If Z is not present, it can be calculated from BETA and SE. \cr
BETA should be : \code{b}, \code{beta}, \code{beta1} \cr
SE should be : \code{se}, \code{std} \cr
